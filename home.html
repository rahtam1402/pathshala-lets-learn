        When I was little, I'd help with that part. That's when my Ma -um, I mean, my mother- taught me how to dry them in the oven.

What does it matter if they’re weeds? They’re pretty all the same. In fact, I’d call them special compared to flowers. Weeds are stronger. They dominate. They grow everywhere, and some are just as pretty as any flower, but people still toss them aside because of what they are. It’s the title that does it, I think.</p>
